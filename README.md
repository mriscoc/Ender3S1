## Disclaimer

Most of the features of this firmware are present in the source code published in this repository. The binary file on the release page has very few newer features no published in the source code, those new features are not ready for be integrated in to the official Marlin repository and publish them only could contribute to code fragmentation, that is the reason because you will find in the source code only the features already integrated into the bugfix branch of Marlin or in evaluation as submited as a pull request. Newer features may not be committed while they are still under development, however will be published here and sent to the upstream Marlin project once they are ready for integration. There may be some delay in source release for some under-development functions as feedback / testing progresses. Once features are finalized, they will be up streamed to the main Marlin project via pull request. Downloading or using the binaries you are agree to waive the right to access to the source code. If you are not agree with the above, please do not download or use the binaries in the release page.
